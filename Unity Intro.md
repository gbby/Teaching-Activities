# 1. Intro to Unity

Unity is a cross-platform game engine that empowers you to "turn your visions into fully interactive experiences" according to its marketing language.

- Download it from https://unity.com/
- Open up the Unity Hub install a recent editor (Unity 6 is recommended). Don't worry about adding any packages for now.
- Once it launches, create a new project. We'll start with a Universal 3D template. Set a project name and appropriate location.

# 2. Explore the Interface

There are 5 main windows that you need to familiarize yourself with:
- The Scene Window. We'll typically arrange our experiences in the scene view. Hold the right mouse button to use WASD to fly around. Clicking the white cube in the centre of the viewer gizmo will change between 3D and isometric views.
- Project Window. This is where you will store all of our assets, including scripts, 3D files, textures, audio files, and scenes. It is very important to keep your project window tidy.
- Hierarchy Window. This shows us a list of all of the objects that are currently in our scene. Objects can be grouped in parent-child relationships, and are are listed in the hierarchy in the order they are added.
- Inspector Window. Here's where we can inspect and modify the properties of any asset that we select.
- Game view. The game view will allow us to activate the scene as if it was being played in a real game format.

Some things you'll want to try:
- The main toolbar is at the top. It contains a bunch of transform tools that you should explore.
- Change your default camera and light assets.
- Add some additional GameObjects and move them around.
- Click on your added objects and look in the Inspector Window. Click on Add Component. Try a particle system under Effects. Add some Physics, such as creating a rigidbody and giving it mass.
- Check out the asset store.

# 3. Populate Your Scene

Unless you are already a Unity wizard, you will need to configure scenes based on example templates and tutorials for the hardware device that you've chosen. We'll look at some different templates for AR/VR later in the course. Some different ways that we can populate our scenes include:
- Importing meshes from Blender and related applications. We can, for example, import entire .blend files like the map of OTU that we created earlier using Blosm.
- We can make use of available textures and materials, or we can design ones of our own outside of Unity and import them.
- We can procedurally generate assets. This is great for custom animated data visualizations.

What should you do over the break is go to https://learn.unity.com/ and try a few different tutorials.
