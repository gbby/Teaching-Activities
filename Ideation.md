# Ideation

Open this Miro board: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJGiqC-w=/?share_link_id=890110857589

The goal of this activity will be to help us examine whether there are themes that turn up when we compare and contrast our peer stories with each other. 

A storyboard is a visual representation of how a story will play out, scene by scene. Because of the association with film production, storyboards are usually made up of a chronological series of images with accompanying notes. In information design, we use them to organize a visual argument and define the user interactions that our readers/viewers/audience will employ. Before we can make storyboards, though, we need to generate some ideas about what will go into them. We call this ideation! Our ideation process will focus on developing context for a story related to the prompt that was previously given - "A Week in the Life of..."

Imagine now that we are tasked with creating a data-driven story about *a week in the life of new graduate students*. We're going to use the notes from the peer interviews generated previously. Are there specific things that stand out? Will trends emerge when we talk about them together? Let's find out!

This will be our organizing strategy:
- Themes will use yellow stickies.
- Characters (i.e. who are the people in our story?) will use green.
- Data (i.e. the datasets or metrics we might want to work with) will use blue.
- Charts (i.e. the different chart and graphic types) in pink.
- Format/media (i.e. storytelling; video; 1-page fact sheet) in orange.

Our first step will be to get stickies up on the board. We're using a miro board, but we might also do this with actual sticky notes - a strategy that is highly recommended in information design.

Here's an example from last year for reference: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLaV99ak=/?share_link_id=56376634388

Once our large board is finished, go into groups of 5 or 6 with the people around you and create your own ideation layer separate from the group one.
- Use the same 5 main stickies.
- Your theme will be "A week in the life of a graduate student at an Ontario university who is facing financial hardship due to affordability issues in Canadian cities."
- Get your ideas up in the form of stickies.
- Add explanatory text.
- Replace main stickies with sketches or images.
- Arrange or cluster your stickies (you can add circles for clusters, lines and arrows for connections and logical flow).
- Increase the size of the stickies you want to focus on.
- Remember... you are looking to create a story thread.
