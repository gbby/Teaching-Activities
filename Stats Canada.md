# 1: Intro to Statistics Canada Data

Statistics Canada, formed in 1971, is the agency of the Government of Canada commissioned with producing statistics to help better understand Canada, its population, resources, economy, society, and culture.

# 2: Getting Census Data

- Start by searching Google for "Stats Canada census of population."
- Land yourself on the first page https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/index-eng.cfm On your own when you have time, spend some time exploring.
- Click on "GeoSearch" under the search bar https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/geo/maps-cartes/geosearch-georecherche/index2021-eng.cfm?client=census&language=EN&DGUID=2021A000011124
- Change the geographic region to either Durham or Oshawa. Note the difference between a few of the categories, though. A "census metropolitan area" (CMA) is a grouping of census subdivisions comprising a large urban area (the "urban core") and those surrounding "urban fringes" with which it is closely integrated. To become a CMA, an area must register an urban core population of at least 100,000 at the previous census. Oshawa can be selected as either a CMA or a census subdivision for the Regional Municipality of Durham census division. Different datasets are available for different geospatial areas.
- Look at the Health Regions tab and select Durham Regional Health Units.
- Click on the 2021 Census Profile Table, which is the most comprehensive data view of the Durham Regional Health Units https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&GENDERlist=1,2,3&STATISTIClist=1,4&HEADERlist=0&DGUIDlist=2022A00073530&SearchText=Durham%20Regional%20Health%20Unit
