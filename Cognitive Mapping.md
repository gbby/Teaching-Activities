# Cognitive Mapping I: Introduction

Organize yourselves into small groups. Grab some pencil crayons and paper. Individually, sketch a "food tour" of some part of the city where you live (or the city where you're from). Your tour should include a route connecting three of your favourite restaurants or places to get food. 

Constraints and Design Considerations:
- Spend 10 minutes sketching out your map.
- You cannot use any text on it - icons and symbols only. Think about what symbols might have meaning.
- Consider how you will represent movement and direction on the map.
- Think about your audience. Are they tourists? Are they familiar with your city?
- Don't worry about making it look pretty.
- When you're done, share your map with your group members and ask them whether it makes sense to them.

# Cognitive Mapping II: Sketch

We'll do this in groups, but you'll work individually until you're told to focus on group discussion. You can chat with your group members while you're working.
- Draw Oshawa. Work from memory (in other words, **do not use a map**!). 5 minutes.
- Next, personalize it. Come up with a story. Places you like. Hangouts. Routes. For now, just write as notes. 5 minutes.
- Next, encode the story in the form of abstract visualization elements (path markers; heatmap/clusters; symbols). 5 minutes.
- Finally, annotate your map. Add a legend or key, title, etc. 5 minutes.

Following this, share your map with your group members. See if they can guess where it refers to. Discuss the following questions and jot down your insights:
- What are the local, everyday interactions and encounters with an image (a GPS system; a local map; a subway map) that affect your own calculations about how a "user" should navigate this civic space? How do iconic or otherwise highly stable representations guide our interactions with those objects?
- How would it be different if there was a subway system and a familiar representation (i.e. a subway map) of it? What does the transit map look like where you grew up? Is it composed of 45 and 90 degree angles? Is it radial?
- What's missing? Did you omit anything?
- How did you highlight personal, idiosyncratic, embodied data experience?
What would you do to make this more engaging or interactive? To make it more inclusive and accessible to a wider audience?
- What other methods could you use to sketch and/or display it (e.g. 3D visualization; isometric projection)?
- What additional data "layers" could you add to it (e.g. walking distances; danger zones)?

When you're done, take a photo of your map. Name it Yourlastname.png and put it in the shared drive: /In-Class Exercises/Cognitive Mapping

# Cognitive Mapping III: Classify

Together, we will classify the elements in the maps based on Kevin Lynch's theories. Remember the acronym PEDNL (Paths, Edges, Districts, Nodes, Landmarks). Here's a visual reference: 
![PEDNL](Images/pednl.png?raw=true)

While scanning through them, we want to examine which elements are common. Some questions we can ask:
- Are car paths more common than footpaths?
- Are the edges natural or human-made?
- What sorts of districts turn up? Campuses? Downtown cores? Tourist zones?
- Are the nodes and intersections linked to human or machine paths?
- Do we see any landmarks? Are they natural or human-made? Are they also attractions?
- Does the orientation of the map tell us anything?

If you like, use a Google Drawing or Miro board to collect ideas or annotate on existing maps. What we're doing is, following Lynch, creating an "image" of the city.
