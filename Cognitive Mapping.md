# Cognitive Mapping I

Orgazing yourselves into small groups. Grab some pencil crayons and paper. Individually, sketch a "food tour" of some part of the city where you live (or the city where you're from). Your tour should include a route connecting three of your favourite restaurants or places to get food. 

Constraints and Design Considerations:
- Spend 10 minutes sketching out your map.
- You cannot use any text on it - icons and symbols only. Think about what symbols might have meaning.
- Consider how you will represent movement and direction on the map.
- Think about your audience. Are they tourists? Are they familiar with your city?
- Don't worry about making it look pretty.
- When you're done, share your map with your group members and ask them whether it makes sense to them.
