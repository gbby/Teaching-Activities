# Peer Story Sketch

Organize yourselves into pairs. Get a piece of paper and a few pencil crayons. Your goal in this exercise will be to sketch the foundation for a data-driven story about your peer. Your theme will be "a week in the life of X." 

Constraints and Design Considerations:
- One of you will interview and sketch for around 8-10 minutes while the other answers questions, and then your roles will reverse. Alternatively, you can both sketch and ask/answer questions at the same time. 
- Here are some example questions, but you'll want to come up with additional questions that might generate interesting data:
  - How much money do you spend in a week or on specific days? What do you spend your money on?
  - What do you eat? When? Where?
  - What do your entertainment choices look like? Do you watch movies? What genres? Do you stream TV shows? On what platforms? How many hours a week do you play video games?
  - What is your screen time like? 
  - Do you exercise? What does that look like?
- Other than the title, you cannot use any text. All of the data you collect about your partner must be represented as numbers, symbols, icons, or charts.
- Include a visual profile of the person you're interviewing.
- Include at least 3-5 insights.
- Think about your layout. Will you use a grid or be free-flowing? Will it resemble a comic book? An infographic? A dashboard? A long-form story?
- Don't worry about making your sketches look too pretty.
